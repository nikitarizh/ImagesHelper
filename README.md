# ImagesHelper
## What is it?
A CLI tool that will resize images for you  
I created it 'cause I do it every day for a CMS called Web Perspective that has a restriction of filesize (300kb max)  
Moreover, in most cases I need width of 500px, and Photoshop is an overkill for a simple resizing
## How to use?
1. Download latest release from Releases tab
2. Simply launch this tool from your command line and follow instructions
